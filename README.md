# 🛒 SyncCart

**Because shared shopping lists should cause fewer arguments, not more.**

---

## 💡 What is SyncCart?

SyncCart is a collaborative shopping list app built for people who like groceries *and* structure.  
Create lists, invite others, track items — and soon: split costs, store loyalty cards, and maybe even avoid that *"who bought the milk?"* moment.

It’s a full-stack project that might be *a bit overkill* for a shopping list, but hey — when you're learning modern tech, go big or go boring.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, WebFlux (reactive), MongoDB  
- **Frontend:** React + Axios  
- **Auth:** Keycloak  
- **Infrastructure:** Dockerized, with a public demo coming soon (hosted on a personal VPS)

---

## 🧠 Why so many moving parts?

Yes, we know — a full-blown reactive backend, OAuth2, and Dockerized services might be a bit much for adding “tomatoes” to a list.  
But this project is not just about the groceries — it’s about **learning modern technologies**, **building real-world architecture**, and creating something that might *actually be useful* someday.  
Better than another `ToDoApp_v3_final_final_REAL.java`, right?

## 🧪 What's coming?

- 💰 Expense tracking & cost sharing  
- 🧾 Loyalty card storage  
- 📊 Basic statistics (e.g., *"You've bought cheese 16 times this month... are you okay?"*)  
- 📱 Mobile-friendly UI  
- 🚀 Public demo link (very soon!)
